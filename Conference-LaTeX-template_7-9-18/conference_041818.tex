\title{Magnet or Sticky? A Stack Overflow Tag-by-Tag Typology\\
}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
<<<<<<< HEAD
Stack Overflow (SO) is one of the most popular question and answer website among software developers. There are many tags in Stack Overflow.  If you ask about Python and tag that post with ``Python'', people interested in Python can follow that tag and see your post. Many questions and answers are received every day for Stack Overflow. We explored how their interest shifted from how they use tags. We classified tags into four types: (1) attractive, (2) stagnant, (3) fluctuating, and (4) terminal based on magnet values and sticky values. We analyze the data from table ``Posts'' which includes about 42 million posts from Stack overflow and table ``Users'' where there are about 9 million rows of user information. Analysis of stack overflow revealed that: 
(1) There were some historical events in IT  such as the launch of new tools and the termination of services when there were characteristics in the transition of magnet value and sticky value.
(2) The types of tags that are classified do not change much.

Stack Overflow (SO) is one of the most popular question and answer website among engineers. There are many tags in Stack Overflow, and with the tag, you can find the questions of your interest smoothly. Many questions and answers are received every day for Stack Overflow.

We classified tags into four types: (1) attractive, (2) stagnant, (3) fluctuating, and (4) terminal based on magnet values and sticky values. Analysis of stack overflow revealed that: 
(1) There were some historical events when there were characteristics in the transition of magnet value and sticky value.
(2) Since the total number of users of stack overflow increases year by year, the graphs of magnet value and sticky value fall to the right, but if they are normalized, the sticky value of the tag is relatively outputted and a new viewpoint is revealed.
(3) In quadrant transitions, tags often remain in the same quadrant~\cite{yamashita2014magnet}.\\

\section{Introduction}
<<<<<<< HEAD
Pew Research Center~\cite{communityeconomic}, an organization that studies problems in the United States and the world, investigated society and population using US tax survey data.  States that have a high percentage of people migrating from the outside are defined as \emph{magnet states} and states where the high proportion of the population who continues to live in the same state since birth are defined as \emph{sticky states}. For example, 86\% of Nevada's population migrated from other states so Nevada state is quite \emph{magnet}. Through such a survey, you can find the tendency how American citizens move.

\smallskip
For many developers, it is important to know the changes in the interests of other developers because popularity among many people should have advantages. Developers always want to work with convenient and easy-to-use tools. To make a project better, excellent developers need to be interested in the project over the long term.\\

According to the definition of magnet and sticky to be defined later, we classified tags used for stack overflow into magnet tags and sticky tags. In addition, we define strong magnetic and strong sticky \emph{attractive}, strong magnet weak sticky \emph{stagnant}, weak magnet strong sticky \emph{fluctuating}, weak magnet defines a weak sticky \emph{terminal}. By classifying like this, we analyzed what we know from the popularity of tags. We examined tags' magnets and sticky values by classifying them as the tags \emph{programming language}, \emph{framework}, and \emph{environment}. We also compared the news and history of software companies and web services, if there are characteristic changes in magnet values and sticky values, we examined why it was like that. We addressed the following two research questions:

<<<<<<< HEAD
In many cases, the sticky value tended to be higher than the magnet value. In addition, the decrease rate was higher for the magnet value than for the sticky value. If it is easy to use and convenient like the .NET Framework, the magnet value and the sticky value are high.

We can identify which tags are obsolete. When the tags move quadrant, we find that something happens.



\section{definition of magnet and sticky}
This section describes how we measure the appeal and adhesion of users on different topics on Stack Overflow in this study, we use the Magnet and Sticky metrics defined by the Pew Research Center for illustrating the migratory trends of citizens in the United States.

The Pew Research Center report defines magnet states as those states where a large proportion of adults who live there have moved from another state. Thus, the magnet metric for a state is the proportion of adult residents of a state who were not born in the state. Furthermore, the report also defines sticky states as those states where a large proportion of adults who were born there continue to live there. Thus, the sticky metric for a state is the proportion of adult residents who were born in the state

These definitions are sound for a study of populations, where a single adult can only occupy one state at a time. However, the definition cannot be applied directly to the topics discussed by the users of Stack Overflow where a user can ask or answer questions on several topics at the same time. Therefore, we expand new definition to apply to topics in Stack Overflow as follows:

\smallskip
\subsection*{\textit{\textbf{Magnet and Sticky in Stack Overflow}}}

Questions in Stack Overflow are composed of the content of the question, answers to the questions and comments~\cite{liu2018mining}, that are call Posts in the database of SOTorrent. Each question has one or more tags that separate the question into different topics. Simultaneously, posts in a question have their own creator (for the question content, one is the questioner, and for the answer, one is the respondent) who is a participant of the topics of the question. We also define the activity of asking or answering questions on some topic as a discussion of the topic. For example, a classical question in Stack overflow has three tags like java, apache, and Linux which is asked by user A and answered by user B, and C, so A, and C are participants of topic java, apache, and Linux.

\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Magnet}
Magnet topics are those that attract a large proportion of new users. Thus, we calculate the magnetism of a topic as the proportion of users who ask or answer during the time period under research to all new users who registered their account at the year.

\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Sticky}
Sticky topics are those where a large proportion of the users will keep participating in the discussion in the time period under research and the following. Thus, we calculate the stickiness of a topic as the proportion of the users who discuss within the topic in the time period under research to who have also discussed in the following time period.

\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Example}
Let us explain how we calculate magnet and stick values for some topics belong to a major category as an example. There are 6 questions (a, b, c, d, e, f) and 7 users (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), the Last Activity Date of question a, b, c is during 2017 and question d, e, f is during 2018. The registration date of user A, B, C, D is during 2017 and the registration date of user E, F, G is during 2018~\cite{yamashita2016magnet}.

\section{definition of magnet and sticky}
Measuring Contributor Retention and Attraction in Questions of Stack Overflow.

This section describes how we measure the appeal and adhesion of users on different topics on Stack Overflow in this study, we use the Magnet and Sticky metrics defined by the Pew Research Center [26] for illustrating the migratory trends of citizens in the United States.

The Pew Research Center report1 defines magnet states as those states where a large proportion of adults who live there have moved from another state. Thus, the magnet metric for a state is the proportion of adult residents of a state who were not born in the state. Furthermore, the report also defines sticky states as those states where a large proportion of adults who were born there continue to live there. Thus, the sticky metric for a state is the proportion of adult residents who were born in the state

*These definitions are sound for a study of populations, where a single adult can only occupy one state at a time. However, the definition cannot be applied directly to the topics discussed by the users of Stack Overflow where **a user can ask or answer questions in several topics at the same time. *Therefore, we expand original definition to apply to topics in Stack Overflow as follows:

\smallskip
\subsection*{\textit{\textbf{Topics discussed in Stack Overflow}}}

Questions in Stack Overflow are composed of the content of the question, answers to the questions and comments~\cite{liu2018mining}, that are call Posts in the database of SOTorrent. Each question has one or more tags that separate the question into different topics. Simultaneously, posts in a question have their own creater (for the content of question, one is the questioner, and for the answer, one is the respondent) who is participant of the topics of the question. We also define the activity of asking or answering questions in some topic as discussion of the topic. For example, a classical questions in Stack overflow has three tags like java, apache and linux which is asked by user A and answered by user B, and C, so A, B and C are participants of topic java apache and linux, by the way, We will discuss the participation of specific topics in several major categories (e.g. C++ and program language), so the three topics java apache and linux are also belong to major categories Programing language, Framework, Environment and OS.
\smallskip

\textbf{Magnet}
Magnets are those that attract a large proportion of new users. Thus, we calculate the magnetism of a topic as the proportion of susers who ask or answer during the time period under research to all new users who registered their account at the year.
\smallskip
\smallskip

\textbf{Sticky}
Sticky topics are those where a large proportion of the users will keep participating in discussion in the time period under research and the following. Thus, we calculate the stickiness of a topic as the proportion of the users who discuss within the topic in the time period under research to who have also discuss in the following time period.

 \caption{Example of Magnet and Sticky values definition} 
 \label{fig:example2} 
\end{figure}
\smallskip
<<<<<<< HEAD

To calculate the magnet metric, we observe that there are four new users who register his/her account in 2017 (A, B, C, and D), and all of them discuss in topic 1, while two of them (B, C) participate in the discussion of topic 2 and 3. In this case, Magnet value of topic 1 in 2017 is 4/4, topic 2 is 2/4 and topic 3 is 2/4.

To calculate the sticky metric, on topic 1, there are three users participate in the discussion in 2017 (A, B and C) but only one of them also participate in the discussion in 2018 (A). Hence, the sticky value of project 1 is 1/4. on topic 2, there are 2 users participate in the discussion in 2017 (B and C) but only one of them also participate in the discussion in 2018 (B). Even though new users E F G participate in the discussion in 2018, we still calculate the value of sticky as 1/2. For the same reason, the sticky of topic 3 is 2/2 in 2018.\\

We merge tags belonging to analogous subjects into one topic,for example tag ``python-2.7'' and tag ``python-3.6'' are merged into topic ``python''. So we get 3 topics in this case. 
Of course different version number suffixes are the most common examples of analogous tags. In our observations, analogous tags that also need to be merged include derivatives of the same technology on different platforms, special tools in a certain tool family, or a combination of a technology with its commonly used library, etc. For example, tag ``reactjs'', ``react-router'', ``reactjs-flux'', ``create-react-app'' should be merged into one topic ``react''.
% Of course, the difference in version number is the most common example of analogous tags. The rest of examples includes derivatives of the technology on different platforms, commonly used libraries, or specific tools in a tool family, etc. for example topic ``react'' includes tag ``reactjs'', ``react-router'', ``reactjs-flux'', ``create-react-app'' etc. 
We can get this information from the ``Related Tag'' column of the ``Tag Info'' on Stack Overflow.''

In our exmaple which is presented in Fig 1 and Fig 2,  question a has tag 1.0, question b has tag 1.1 and question f has tag 1.2 , which means according to our merge rule, they all belong to topic 1.  Simultaneously, question c has tag 2.0 and tag 3.1, which means it belongs to topic 2 and 3 at the same time. Therefore, queston d belongs to topic 2 and question e belongs to topic 3.

\section{Dataset}
In this paper, we analyze the Stack Overflow dataset provided by Sebastian Baltes et al~\cite{msr2019challenge} called SOTorrent. 

SOTorrent is “an open dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks.

The dataset includes 20 different tables which store not only data from official SO data dump but also data extracted from the original official SO data dump.

In this paper, we only analyze the data from table \emph{Posts} which includes about 42 million posts from Stack overflow and table \emph{Users} where there are about 9 million rows of user information from July 2008 to September 2018 and we pay attention to users, tags, and time information of questions.

In this paper, we consider a user to be one who asks or answers questions in Stack Overflow. Those who comment or like/unlike on questions or answers are not counted in the statistics.

Let us take the survey of magnet and sticky of some topics belong to a major category as a example. There are 6 questions (a, b, c, d, e, f) and 7 users (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), the Last Activity Date of question a, b, c is during 2017 and question d, e, f is during 2018. the register date of user A, B, C, D is during 2017 and the register date of user E, F, G is during 2018~\cite{yamashita2016magnet}.

Questions have different tags. We merge tags belonging to the same topic into one topic,for example tag "python-2.7" and tag "python-3.6" are merged into topic "python". So we get 3 topics in this case.

To calculate the magnet metric, we observe that there are four new users who register his/her account in 2017 (A, B, C and D), and all of them discuss in topic 1, while two users (BC) discuss in topic 2 and two users participate in the discussion of topic 3. In this case, Magnet value of topic 1 in 2017 is 4/4, topic 2 is 2/4 and topic is 2/4.

To calculate the sticky metric, on topic 1, there are three users participate in the discussion in 2017 (A, B and C) but only one of them also participate in the discussion in 2018 (A). Hence, the sticky value of project 1 is 1/4 . on topic 2, there are 2 users participate in the discussion in 2017 (B and C) but only one of them also participate in the discussion in 2018 (B). Even though new users E F G participate in the discussion in 2018, we still calculate the value of sticky as 1/2 .For the same reason, the sticky of topic 3 is 2/2 in {2018}


\section{Dataset}
In this paper, we anlyze the Stack Overflow dataset provided by [Sebastian Baltes -> SOTorrent: Reconstructing and Analyzing the Evolution of Stack Overflow Posts.] called SOTorrent. 

SOTorrent is “an open dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks. It connects SO posts to other platforms by aggregating URLs from text blocks and by collecting references from GitHub files to SO posts.”

The dataset includes 20 different table which store not only data from official SO data dump but also data extracted from original data dump.

However , in this paper , we only anlyze the data from table "Posts" which includes about 42 million posts from Stack overflow and table "Users" where there are about 9 million rows of user information and pay attation to user , tag and time informaiton of questions

In this paper, we consider a user to be one who ask or answer questions in Stack Overflow, Those who comment or like/unlike on questions or answers are not counted in the statistics.

\section{STUDY RESULTS} %paragraph4
<<<<<<< HEAD
We set research results and faced two questions against these results. We discuss the questions based on the results.
\smallskip
\smallskip

\textbf{(RQ1) What are typical values of magnet and sticky in Stack Overflow?}
\smallskip

We have calculated magnet and sticky values as defined in section 2. And we plotted the magnet value on the vertical axis and the sticky value on the horizontal axis. We classified the plotted points into 4 quadrants.\\
\textbf
{Attractive:} Tag with the high magnet and sticky value. By knowing attractive tags, we can find out what the developers are interested in.\\
\textbf{Fluctuating:} Tag with high magnet and low sticky value. This tag attracts people but it is short-term. Excellent developers will not continue to be interested.\\
\textbf{Stagnant:} Tag with the low magnet and high sticky value. These tags are difficult to attract new users but maintain existing users.\\
\textbf{Terminal:} Tag with the Low magnet and low sticky value. This tag can neither attract new users' developers nor keep them interested.
\smallskip
\smallskip

In this paper, the median of the magnet and sticky values for each year is used for the threshold of the quadrant because the median value is not much affected by outliers. As we showed the sticky value definition in section 2, the sticky value depends on the number of tag users in that year and the following year. So in order to answer RQ1, we got 9 years' worth of sticky value from the information on the number of tag users from 2009 to 2018. The sticky value must depend on the number of new tag users but if the number of new tag users in the target year is too low, the sticky value will be too small. Therefore, in order to remove noise, we decided thresholds for each topic and when the magnet and sticky value is less than the threshold value, it is set to 0.
We did not investigate all the tags at once, but analyzed it in three categories. That is because it makes it easier to find features.\\

We did not analyze all the tags at once, but divided them into three categories for analysis. It is because it is easy to find the feature. The categories we selected and their contents are programming languages ​​(assembly, Bash, C, C♯, C ++, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, SQL, Swift, TypeScript), frameworks ( .NET Framework, Angular, Cordova, Django, Hadoop, Node.js, React, Spark, Spring, TensorFlow, Torch, Xamarin), and environment (Android Studio, Atom Editor, Eclipse, Emacs, IntelliJ, IPython, Jupyter, NetBeans, Notepad++, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RStudio, RubyMine, Sublime Text, TextMate, Vim, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Xcode).
We chose these tags based on Stack Overflow's survey of over 100,000 developers in 2018. We focused on tags used by more than 5\% of developers who answered the questionnaire. The year when StackOverflow released these data is May 2008. Since the sticky value is calculated from the difference between the previous year and the current year, the distribution chart of magnet and sticky value according to three categories in 2010 is shown as the first year for which yearly data of sticky value can be obtained.

% 我々は全てのタグを一度に調査するのではなく3つのカテゴリに分けて分析をした。その方が特徴を見つけやすいからである。我々が選んだカテゴリたちとその内容はプログラミング言語(assembly, Bash, C, C♯, C++, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, SQL, Swift, TypeScript), フレームワーク(.NET Framework, Angular, Cordova, Django, Hadoop, Node.js, React, Spark, Spring, TensorFlow, Torch, Xamarin),そして環境(Android Studio, Atom Editor, Eclipse, Emacs, IntelliJ, IPython, Jupyter, NetBeans, Notepad++, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RStudio, RubyMine, Sublime Text, TextMate, Vim, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Xcode)である。
% これらを選んだ理由は2018年にStack Overflowが10万人を超える開発者たちにとったアンケートの結果に基づいている。Stack Overflowは開発者たちに使用するタグたちについてのアンケートをとり、我々はアンケートに答えた開発者たちの5\%以上が使用しているタグたちに絞って調査した。StackOverflowがこれらのデータを公開した年は2008年5月である。sticky値は前年と当年の差から算出しているため、sticky valueの通年データが取れる最初の年として2010年の3カテゴリ別のmagnetとsticky valueの分布図を示す。

% The categories we selected and their contents are programming languages (assembly, Bash, C, C\#, C++, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, SQL, Swift, TypeScript), framework (.NET, Angular, Cordova, Django, Hadoop, Node.js, React, Spark, Spring, TensorFlow, Torch, Xamarin), and the environment (Android Studio, Atom Editor, Eclipse, Emacs, IntelliJ, IPython, Jupyter, NetBeans, Notepad++, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RStudio, RubyMine, Sublime Text, TextMate, Vim, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Xcode) because these three categories are one of the most popular tag categories used in stack overflow. We also analyzed by picking the top tags that are popular among each category. Tags that are not popular have no character and we do not know anything from that. By dividing it for each category, it became easier to see the features. We show distribution map of magnet and sticky value by 3 categories of 2010 as one of the characteristics easy to understand.
\medskip



\textbf{Manual analysis:}
From Figure~\ref{2010}, .NET Framework is a high magnet and sticky value. It can be said that it is very good to be a high magnet and sticky value. This is because the magnet value of .NET that was on the net is high because beginner developers can develop somewhat advanced software. Are there many reasons why the .NET Framework's sticky value is high reasons most conveniently? It is the foundation system for building applications. Java has long been popular and attractive as it is one of the most famous programming languages ​​in the world. Eclipse especially attracted people in 2010, so the magnet value is high.
\medskip

% 図~\ref{plotframe2010}の2009 Frameworkにおいて、.NET Frameworkは高いマグネットとスティッキー値である。高いマグネットとスティッキー値であることは非常に良いと言える。.NET Framework は、2006年11月にマイクロソフトに発表された。これはネットワーク上でアプリケーションを構築する基盤のシステムである。.NET Frameworkのmagnet valueが高い理由は、初心者エンジニアでもある程度高度なソフトウェアを開発できるからである。.NET Frameworkのsticky valueが高い理由はその利便性から長く使う人が多いからだ。
% 2009 Languageにおいて、C♯のmagnet valueとsticky valueは最も高い。これは.NET構想において、C♯が中心的な開発言語であり、そのフレームワークは.NET Frameworkであることが理由のように思われる。
% 2009 Environmentにおいて、Visual Studioが高いmagnet valueとsticky valueである。Visual Studioは.NET構想を作ったMicrosoftが作った最も代表的な開発環境である。PhpStormは高いsticky valueと低いmagnet valueである。PhpStormはPHPでの開発に向いており、それはコード補完の点で優れている。PHPで開発をしない人々にとってはあまり魅力的ではないが、PHPを使う人々にとっては非常に魅力的であるためこのような結果になったと思われる。
% \medskip


\textbf{Quantitive results:}
Figure~\ref{fig:2010} shows a quadrant plot of the magnet and sticky values ​​of the 2010 framework, programming language, environmental tag from the left. From the values ​​on the vertical axis and the horizontal axis in Figure~\ref{fig:2010}, we can see that the magnet value is lower than the value of sticky. In other words, it is more common that the tag used in the overflow is not a magnet but a tag. This is also in the investigation of the Pew Research Center mentioned earlier. Like citizens are more likely to spend more time living on the same land than to change houses,  it is easier for developers to continue developing about the same content.
\smallskip
% 図~\ref{plotframe2010}は左からプログラミング言語、フレームワーク、環境タグのmagnet とsticky value象限プロットを示している。ここでは、我々はStackOverflowからマイニングできる最初のデータとして2009年のものをピックアップしている。図\ref{plotframe2010}の縦軸と横軸の値から、magnetの値がstickyの値よりもかなり低いことがわかる。つまりスタックオーバーフローで使われているタグはmagnetではなくstickyであることの方が一般的である。これは先ほど述べたPew Research Centerの調査にも当てはまる。市民が拠点を転々とするよりも同じ土地で暮らし続けた方が過ごしやすいように、エンジニアたちも同じ内容に関するタグたちを使って開発を続けやすい傾向にある。
% \smallskip
%   

\begin{oframed}
 % \emph{Stickyの方がmagnetより一般的な属性である。高いmagnet valueのタグは初心者でも使いやすいものである。特に.NET Frameworkのようなmagnetなタグは比較的使いやすいものであるため初心者などに多く使われている。C♯のように古くからあり有名なタグはmagnet valueもsticky valueも高くAttractiveである。また.NETのように一つの優れた構想に関連のある環境やプログラミング言語もまた人気である。 

 Tags with high magnet value are easy to use even for beginners. A tag that is familiar from old days like Java has a high magnet value and sticky value and is attractive. Also from the eclipse example, the trend of tags can often be affected by something unrelated to itself.
 \smallskip\smallskip
=======
We got research results and faced two questions against these results. We discuss the questions based on the results.
\smallskip
\smallskip

\textbf{(RQ1) What are typical values of magnet and sticky in OSS?}
\smallskip

We have calculated magnet and sticky values as defined in section 2. And we plotted the magnet value on the vertical axis and the sticky value on the horizontal axis. We classified the plotted points into 4 quadrants.
\smallskip
\smallskip

\textbf{Attractive:} Tag with high magnet and sticky value. By knowing attractive tags, we can find out what the engineers are interested in.\\
\textbf{Fluctuating:} Tagwith high magnet and low sticky value. This tag attracts people but it is short-term. Excellent engineers will not continue to be interested.\\
\textbf{Stagnant:} Tag with low magnet and high sticky value. These tags are difficult to attract new users, but maintain existing users.\\
\textbf{Terminal:} Tag with Low magnet and low sticky value. This tag can neither attract new users' engineers nor keep them interested.
\smallskip
\smallskip

In this paper, the median of magnet and sticky values for each year is used for the threshold of the quadrant because the median value is not much affected by outliers. As we showed the sticky value definition in section 2, the sticky value depends on the number of tag users in that year and the following year. So in order to answer RQ1, we got 9 years' worth of sticky value from the information on the number of tag users from 2009 to 2018. The sticky value must depend on the number of new tag users but if the number of new tag users in the target year is too low, the sticky value will be too small. Therefore, in order to remove noise, we decided thresholds for each topic, and we set them all below zero. 
\medskip


\textbf{Quantitive results:}
Figure~\ref{plotframe2010} shows a quadrant plot of the magnet and sticky values ​​of the 2010 framework, programming language, environmental tag from the left. From the values ​​on the vertical axis and the horizontal axis in Figure \ref{plotframe2010}, you can see that the value of magnet is lower than the value of sticky. In other words, it is more common that the tag used in the overflow is not a magnet but a tag. This is also in the investigation of the Pew Research Center mentioned earlier. The engine tends to continue to develop using the tags of the same content so that those who have continued to live on the same land rather than tranquil are easy to pass away.\smallskip
\smallskip

\textbf{Manual analysis:}
From Figure~\ref{plotframe2010}, .net is a high magnet and sticky value. It can be said that it is very good to be a high magnet and sticky value. The .NET Framework was announced to Microsoft in November 2006. This is because the magnet value of .NET that was on the net is high because beginner engines can develop somewhat advanced software. Are there many reasons why the .NET sticky value is high reasons most conveniently? It is the foundation system for building applications. It is from. Java has long been popular and attractive as it is one of the most famous programming languages ​​in the world. Eclipse attracted people in 2010, so the magnet value is high. There was no big change in eclipse in 2010, I guessed that the popularity of the word eclipse soared in the Google trend where the movie of TheTwilight Saga: Eclipse has been released in this year, so I am influencing it .\medskip
 
\begin{oframed}
 \emph{Tags with high magnet value are easy to use even for beginners. Especially magnet tags like .NET are relatively easy to use so tags famous for old like tag like java used a lot for beginners etc are attractive both magnet value and sticky value are high. Also from the eclipse example, the trend of tags can often be affected by something unrelated to itself.}

\textbf{(RQ2) How do magnet and sticky values change over time?} \\
\smallskip
\textbf{Approach:}
From 2010 to 2018, we calculated the probability that the tags move quadrants from one year to the following year. For example, there are six Attractive tags in 2010. Of the six tags that were Attactive in 2010, there are five that were Attractive the following year as well. Therefore, the transition probability from Attractive to Attractive for 2010 - 2011 is 5/6 or 83.3\%. Table~\ref{table2} shows the average of this transition probability from 2010 to 2018.


\textbf{Manual analysis:}
Table~\ref{table1} shows the transition of each tag quadrant in the framework. From this table we can see how the tags move in the quadrant. Here we turn to Xamarin as an interesting example. Basically, Xamarin is an API for Android and iOS that can be called from C♯, so you can not develop an application without knowing both details. This means that if you start developing Android and iOS apps with Windows and Visual Studio you will need a lot of knowledge, which is not good for beginners. When Xamarin first appeared, it attracted attention as a tool that developers can efficiently develop. However, on sites where beginners often ask questions, such as StackOverflow, its popularity seems to have gradually declined due to its use difficulty.
About Riact, this is a JavaScript library from Facebook. It aims to build the user interface of web application efficiently. It was first used on Facebook's news feed in 2011 and in 2012 on Instagram. It was open sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. SNSs such as FaceBook and Instagram have begun to become popular around 2015-2016, when React has changed from Terminal to Floating. Therefore, it seems that the popularity of Framework that builds it to popular SNS has also changed.
% 表2はフレーフレームワークにおいて各タグの象限の変遷を示している。この表から、我々はタグたちがどのように象限を変遷していくかがわかる。ここで、面白い例としてXamarinに注目する。Xamarinは基本的にAndroid API,iOSのAPIをC♯から呼び出せるようにしたものなので、両者について知らないとアプリ開発ができない。つまりWindows と Visual StudioでAndroidとiOSアプリの開発を始める場合大変多くの知識を必要とするため初心者には向かない。Xamarinが登場した当初は開発者たちが効率よく開発できるツールとして注目を浴びたが、StackOverflowのように初心者が質問することが多いサイトにおいてはそのしよう難易度の高さから徐々に人気が減少していったのだろうと思われる。
% またRiactについて、これはFacebookとコミュニティによって開発されているユーザインタフェースを構築するためのJavaScriptライブラリである。2011年にFacebookのニュースフィード上で最初に使用され、2012年にはInstagramでも使用されるようになった。2013年5月のJSConf USでオープンソース化された。FaceBookやInstagramなどのSNSが人気になり始めたのはちょうどReactがTerminalからFluctuatingに変遷した2015-2016年ごろであるため、人気のSNSに合わせてそれを構築するFrameworkの人気も変化したのではないかと思われる。

% Table~\ref{table2} shows the transition of the quadrant of each tag in the framework. From this table we can see how the tags are turning quadrants.
% Table~\ref{table2} shows that framework tags often stay in the same quadrant. It turns out that tags frequently change between Attractive and Stagnant, Terminal and Fluctuating.
\smallskip\smallskip

\textbf{Quantitive results:}
Table~\ref{table2} shows the proportion that the vertical axis is in that quadrant for some years up to 2009-2018, the horizontal axis is that year old. From the table, it can be seen that the ratio of tags that do not move the quadrants from the previous year to the following year is the highest in any field of programming language, framework, environment. Since the tags have hardly changed from any quadrant to *, once the tags have become popular to a certain extent, the users of the tags have not been significantly reduced since then. It also shows that once tags have become less popular, it will be difficult to become popular again.
\smallskip

\begin{oframed}
\emph{Table~\ref{table1} shows that even if it was a tool that was initially popular, its popularity would decline if it was difficult to use. Even if it was a tool that was not as popular as it was born, It turns out that as the content using the tool becomes popular, the tool also becomes popular. Table~\ref{table2} shows that it is difficult for tags to make large changes in quadrants.}
% 表1から、タグたちは四分円を大きく変遷しづらいことがわかった。また表2から、たとえ当初人気があったツールだとしても、それが使いにくいあるいは使用するのが難しいものであればその人気は減少し、また誕生当初はそこまで人気がないツールだとしても、そのツールを使用しているコンテンツが人気になればそれに伴いそのツールも人気になることがわかった。

% As a result of investigating from 2009 to 2018, in the programming language, the average transition from Attractive to Attractive was 91.5\%, the transition from Fluctuating to Fluctuating was 77.8\%, the change from Stagnant to Stagnant was 80.6\%, and the change from Terminal to Terminal was 87.2\%.  Regardless of the kind of tag, it turned out that the classification of tags was difficult to change.

\textbf{(RQ2) How do magnet and sticky values change over time?} \\
\smallskip\smallskip
\textbf{Approach:}
We investigated how the tags move with time over the quadrants.\\
\textbf{Quantitive results:}
Table~\ref{table1} shows the proportion that the vertical axis is in that quadrant for some years up to 2009-2018, the horizontal axis is that year old. From the table, it can be seen that the ratio of tags that do not move the quadrants from the previous year to the following year is the highest in any field of programming language, framework, environment. Since it has not changed from any quadrant to *, once popularity comes up to a certain degree, the users of that tag never decrease extremely.

\section{Conclusions}

Whether it's a programming language or a program framework or an operating system, keeping the community alive and attracting more people to participate in discussions is critical to its development. Especially on the stack overflow, the world's largest program Q\&A platform, having more questions and answers on a topic means that customers of the product are more likely to solve their own problems, which is even more tedious than that developers rack their brains to write a lengthy development document or Q\&A This paper applied the magnet and sticky population concepts to a set of topics in Stack Overflow. We find that:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. The number of topics that people participate in is exploding with the development and popularity of computer technology. Even the most popular themes cannot attract the high percentage of people involved in the discussion like what they did ten years ago.

3. This research can provide some reference for enterprises to choose their own main technology stack, and can also be used as a reference for computer science students to learn new technologies, because it (1) predicts the trend of computer technology in the next few years, (2) points out which technologies are easier to access and the questions can be easier to get answers to.

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
% ``Temperature/K''.
% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
